## Overview
The goal of this project is to adapt the foundation model MedSAM (https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM) for segmentation of neuroanatomical structures and compare the performance against a Unet baseline. We use 1,113 T1w MPRAGE MRI's from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult cohort, along with the matching FreeSurfer segmentations, for finetuning the model.
